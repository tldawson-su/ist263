    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Hello!</h2>

    I'm Tyler Latimer Dawson and I'm the creator behind Latimer Design.

    <br><br>

    I'm from Los Angeles, CA and I'm currently studying Advertising at Syracuse University in New York. I've had a passion for both graphic design and soccer for a long time. I've played soccer since I was 5 years old and I started following my local team, the LA Galaxy, in 2014. A few years after that, I started an Instagram account dedicated to following LA Galaxy transfer rumors and news and it was there that I started becoming interested in graphic design, and more specifically sport related designs. I wanted to create better graphics for my own account, so I started teaching myself Photoshop by watching YouTube videos and experimenting with different designs and logos. In 2020, I stopped posting and became too busy with school and sports to keep up to date with news, but I kept designing and experimenting with Photoshop when I had free time.  

    <br><br>

    I returned to my account in 2022, not as a Galaxy news page, but as a graphic design account, and I started posting the old concept kits I had made and working on new designs to post. I named the page Latimer Design after my middle name to keep a little bit of that anonymity but also tie it strongly to myself.

    <br><br>

    Looking forward, I want to continue to add to my portfolio of kit concepts, delve into other sports designs, and try my hand at redesigning logos.
