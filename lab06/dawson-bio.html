        <h1>Tyler Dawson's Bio</h1>

        <p>I am an Advertising major and CRS minor studing at Syracuse University, interested in graphic design, strategy, and media planning.</p>

        <p>I'm from <strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong> where I've lived my whole life but now, I really like living on the East Coast too.</p>

        <p>I work for the Daily Orange on campus, delivering the newspaper and selling ads, and I'm hoping to continue my Advertising internship with Publicis Media this summer, working on media buying and planning.</p>

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>

        <p>Outside of school and work I'm a huge fan of sports, mainly soccer and f1. I like binge watching tv shows and movies, and I love to cook and bake when I have the time.</p>
